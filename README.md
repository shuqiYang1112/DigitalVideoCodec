This project is a digital video codec system. By using a variety of different algorithms, the gains and losses of various trade-offs (various important parameters) are analyzed. Such as throughput, power consumption, cost, programmability, time to market, and application-specific aspects such as quality, target bit rate, latency, and error resilience.
